    "-  Flag error if the reservoir heat content is depleted before the project lifetime\n",
    "-  EGS gradient sections need to be reviewed if there is more than one gradient\n",
    "-  User should use only one value for all or define all four. If user has 50 gradient 1 and 75 gradient 2, 75 should be assigned to the 3 and 4\n",
    "- Flash steam power plants are relatively a common method used to convert the geothermal energy into electricity when production wells produce a mixture of steam and liquid in a geothermal system. In comparison to the single flash system, the double flash steam power plant generates more power from geothermal fluid at the same conditions. However, electricity generation costs are higher for double flash plants. A thermoeconomic optimization model is presented in this paper as the generation costs of single and double flash steam power plants. By considering the pressures in the separator and flash vessel (only in a double flash plant) as the independent variables in the objective function and using numerical search methods (Golden Ratio and Nelder-Mead ), the minimum power generation cost was calculated at different geofluid conditions for either single or double flash steam power plants.\n",
    "- Might need to implement a time-varying efficiency of the chiller based on yearly ambient temperature\n",
    "- Flag Flash is only suitable after this depth (specify depth)\n",
    "- Add injection temperature as an input to the engage user \n",
    "- Lifetime should be an input not an output\n",
    "- Flash systems tell user to keep prod temperature target above 200\n",
    "- We need to set up degradation into the technology to address how a technology performs over time\n",
    "- Change the config to allow for doublet and triplet configs only, set a new param called `well_type` with two options `doublet` or `triplet` and then set the number of well_type in `number of wells`"
